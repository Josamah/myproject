          Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other similar projects would include pychecker (now defunct), pyflakes, flake8, and mypy. The default coding style used by Pylint is close to PEP 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pylint will display a number of messages as it analyzes the code and it can also be used for displaying some statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files. The messages are classified under various categories such as errors and warnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, the code is given an overall mark, based on the number and severity of the warnings and errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          What Pylint says is not to be taken as gospel and Pylint isn't smarter than you are: it may warn you about things that you have conscientiously done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pylint tries hard to report as few false positives as possible for errors, but it may be too verbose with warnings. That's for example because it tries to detect things that may be dangerous in a context, but are not in others, or because it checks for some things that you don't care about. Generally, you shouldn't expect Pylint to be totally quiet about your code, so don't necessarily be alarmed if it gives you a hell lot of messages for your project!
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to tackle pylint's verboseness is to:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Enable or disable the messages or message categories that you want to be activated or not for when pylint is analyzing your code. This can be done easily through a command line flag. For instance, disabling all convention messages is simple as a --disable=C option added to pylint command.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Enable or disable the messages or message categories that you want to be activated or not for when pylint is analyzing your code. This can be done easily through a command line flag. For instance, disabling all convention messages is simple as a --disable=C option added to pylint command.

          Tutorial
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Author: Robert Kirkpatrick
        </p>
        <p>
          Intro
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginner to coding standards? Pylint can be your guide to reveal what's really going on behind the scenes and help you to become a more aware programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing code is a rewarding endeavor. Putting your code out there can be either an act of philanthropy, coming of age, or a basic extension of belief in open source. Whatever the motivation, your good intentions may not have the desired outcome if people find your code hard to use or understand. The Python community has formalized some recommended programming styles to help everyone write code in a common, agreed-upon style that makes the most sense for shared code. This style is captured in PEP 8, the "Style Guide for Python Code". Pylint can be a quick and easy way of seeing if your code has captured the essence of PEP 8 and is therefore friendly to other potential users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you're not ready to share your code but you'd like to learn a bit more about writing better code and don't know where to start. Pylint can tell you where you may have run astray and point you in the direction to figure out what you have done and how to do better.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tutorial is all about approaching coding standards with little or no knowledge of in-depth programming or the code standards themselves. It's the equivalent of skipping the manual and jumping right in.

          My command line prompt for these examples is:
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting Started
        </p><div class="colored_div">
        <p>
          Running Pylint with no arguments will invoke the help dialogue and give you an idea of the arguments available to you. Do that now, i.e.:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
          robertk01 Desktop$ pylint
         <p>
        ...
         </p>
          a bunch of stuff
          ...
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of the options that we'll focus on here are:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
          Commands:
          --help-msg=<msg-id>
          --generate-rcfile
          Messages control:
          --disable=<msg-ids>
          Reports:
          --reports=<y or n>
          --output-format=<format>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need more detail, you can also ask for an even longer help message, like so:
        </P>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
          robertk01 Desktop$ pylint --long-help
          ...
          Even more stuff
          ...
        </div>
         </p>
        <p>
          Pay attention to the last bit of this longer help output. This gives you a hint of what Pylint is going to pick on:
          </P>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        Output:
        Using the default text output, the message format is :
        MESSAGE_TYPE: LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE
        There are 5 kind of message types :
        * (C) convention, for programming standard violation
        * (R) refactor, for bad code smell
        * (W) warning, for python specific problems
        * (E) error, for probable bugs in the code
        * (F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing
        further processing.
        </div>
         </p>
        <p>
          When Pylint is first run on a fresh piece of code, a common complaint is that it is too noisy. The current default configuration is set to enforce all possible warnings. We'll use some of the options I noted above to make it suit your preferences a bit better (and thus make it emit messages only when needed).

          We'll use a basic Python script as fodder for our tutorial. The starting code we will use is called simplecaesar.py and is here in its entirety:
        </P>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        #!/usr/bin/env python3

        import string;

        shift = 3
        choice = input("would you like to encode or decode?")
        word = input("Please enter text")
        letters = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits
        encoded = ''
        if choice == "encode":
        for letter in word:
        if letter == ' ':
        encoded = encoded + ' '
        else:
        x = letters.index(letter) + shift
        encoded = encoded + letters[x]
        if choice == "decode":
        for letter in word:
        if letter == ' ':
        encoded = encoded + ' '
        else:
        x = letters.index(letter) - shift
        encoded = encoded + letters[x]

        print(encoded)
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we run this:

        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        robertk01 Desktop$ pylint simplecaesar.py

        -----------------------------------
        Your code has been rated at 7.37/10
        </div>
        </P>
        <p>
          Previous experience taught me that the default output for the messages needed a bit more info. We can see the second line is:
        </P>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        "simplecaesar.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)"
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          This basically means that line 1 violates a convention C0114. It's telling me I really should have a docstring. I agree, but what if I didn't fully understand what rule I violated. Knowing only that I violated a convention isn't much help if I'm a newbie. Another piece of information there is the message symbol between parens, missing-module-docstring here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I want to read up a bit more about that, I can go back to the command line and try this:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        robertk01 Desktop$ pylint --help-msg=missing-module-docstring
        :missing-module-docstring (C0114): *Missing module docstring*
        Used when a module has no docstring.Empty modules do not require a docstring.
        This message belongs to the basic checker.
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, ok. That one was a bit of a no-brainer, but I have run into error messages that left me with no clue about what went wrong, simply because I was unfamiliar with the underlying mechanism of code theory. One error that puzzled my newbie mind was:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        :too-many-instance-attributes (R0902): *Too many instance attributes (%s/%s)*
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          I get it now thanks to Pylint pointing it out to me. If you don't get that one, pour a fresh cup of coffee and look into it - let your programmer mind grow!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Next Step
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we got some configuration stuff out of the way, let's see what we can do with the remaining warnings.

          If we add a docstring to describe what the code is meant to do that will help. There are 5 invalid-name messages that we will get to later. Lastly, I put an unnecessary semicolon at the end of the import line so I'll fix that too. To sum up, I'll add a docstring to line 2, and remove the ; from line 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the updated code:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        """This script prompts a user to enter a message to encode or decode
        using a classic Caesar shift substitution (3 letter shift)"""

        import string

        shift = 3
        choice = input("would you like to encode or decode?")
        word = input("Please enter text")
        letters = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits
        encoded = ''
        if choice == "encode":
        for letter in word:
        if letter == ' ':
        encoded = encoded + ' '
        else:
        x = letters.index(letter) + shift
        encoded = encoded + letters[x]
        if choice == "decode":
        for letter in word:
        if letter == ' ':
        encoded = encoded + ' '
        else:
        x = letters.index(letter) - shift
        encoded = encoded + letters[x]

        print(encoded)
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is what happens when we run it:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">

          Your code has been rated at 8.42/10 (previous run: 7.37/10, +1.05)
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Nice! Pylint told us how much our code rating has improved since our last run, and we're down to just the invalid-name messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are fairly well defined conventions around naming things like instance variables, functions, classes, etc. The conventions focus on the use of UPPERCASE and lowercase as well as the characters that separate multiple words in the name. This lends itself well to checking via a regular expression, thus the should match (([A-Z_][A-Z1-9_]*)|(__.*__))$.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case Pylint is telling me that those variables appear to be constants and should be all UPPERCASE. This is an in-house convention that has lived with Pylint since its inception. You too can create your own in-house naming conventions but for the purpose of this tutorial, we want to stick to the PEP 8 standard. In this case, the variables I declared should follow the convention of all lowercase. The appropriate rule would be something like: "should match [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$". Notice the lowercase letters in the regular expression (a-z versus A-Z).
        </p>
        <p>
          If we run that rule using a --const-rgx='[a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]{2,30}$' option, it will now be quite quiet:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="colored_div">
          robertk01 Desktop$ pylint --const-rgx='[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$' simplecaesar.py

          -------------------------------------------------------------------
          Your code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: 8.42/10, +1.58)
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular expressions can be quite a beast so take my word on this particular example but go ahead and read up on them if you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tip: It would really be a pain to specify that regex on the command line all the time, particularly if we're using many other options. That's what a configuration file is for. We can configure our Pylint to store our options for us so we don't have to declare them on the command line. Using a configuration file is a nice way of formalizing your rules and quickly sharing them with others. Invoking pylint --generate-rcfile will create a sample rcfile with all the options set and explained in comments.
